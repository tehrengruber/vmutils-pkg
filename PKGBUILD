# vmagent and friends from the upstream release tarball.
#
# Vendored rather than taken from the AUR. The AUR carries vmutils-bin, which
# was current when this was written, and victoriametrics-agent, which had been
# flagged out of date for ten months while still looking like a maintained
# package. Neither had more than two votes. Packaging it here costs a pkgver
# and two checksums per release (see ./update.sh), which is cheaper than
# carrying that risk.
#
# Binaries only, exactly like vmutils-bin: the vmagent unit is environment
# specific (remote write target, scrape config), so none is shipped here.
